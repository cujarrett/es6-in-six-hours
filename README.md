# ES6 in Six Weeks

#### What

> **If you havenâ€™t learned ES6 yet, the time is now. - Eric Elliott**

ES6 also know as ECMAScript 6 or ECMAScript 2015 is a fun and interesting addition to JavaScript. There's lots of ways to learn the content, here's my take on the topics. It's meant to have a low barrier of entry and to be consumed in six one hour sessions.

Also, ES6 in Seven Weeks isn't as catchy :smile:
